# PHASE-0-GPS
git - Version Control System 

git clone <url> - Makes a copy of the content from Github into our local computer

touch <filename> - Creates a new blank file

git add <filename> - add files to the staging area (we've created a point where we could save the files, but if we don't like the changes we can "unstage" them.)

git commit -m - saves a file with a message.  The commit message should be in the present tense. Present tense is used so we are always working with something present, even if we decide to use a previous commit and rebuild from there. 

git push - sends all committed changes we made to the local repository to Github (the remote repository).

git checkout -b <branchname> - Creates a new branch.
